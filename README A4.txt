When adding the repeated sequence of the notes, I simply copied the sequence in the notes list, which 
resulted in an alliance between the repeated sequences. When lower (and also upper) the octave (as well as when extending the duration), the octaves of the alliances were lowered(upper, duration extended) twice.
